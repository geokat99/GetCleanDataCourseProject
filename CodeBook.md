####Initial Data Set Information:
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years.  
Each person performed six activities

    WALKING
    WALKING_UPSTAIRS
    WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
    SITTING
    STANDING
    LAYING 
wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and Gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear Accelerometer and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and Gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor Accelerometer signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body Accelerometer and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. 
From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

Attribute Information:
For each record in the dataset it is provided:
- Triaxial Accelerometer from the accelerometer (total Accelerometer) and the estimated body Accelerometer.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the Gyroscope.
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
- Its activity label.
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment. 

####Tidy Data Set Information:
From the initial data set were extracted only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation 
for each measurement. 
Measurements of

    fBodyAcc-meanFreq()-X
    fBodyAcc-meanFreq()-Y
    fBodyAcc-meanFreq()-Z
    fBodyAccJerk-meanFreq()-X
    fBodyAccJerk-meanFreq()-Y
    fBodyAccJerk-meanFreq()-Z
    fBodyGyro-meanFreq()-X
    fBodyGyro-meanFreq()-Y
    fBodyGyro-meanFreq()-Z

    fBodyBodyAccJerkMag-meanFreq()
    fBodyBodyGyroMag-meanFreq()
    fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-meanFreq()
    angle(tBodyAccJerkMean),gravityMean)
    angle(tBodyGyroMean,gravityMean)
    angle(tBodyGyroJerkMean,gravityMean)
    angle(X,gravityMean)
    angle(Y,gravityMean)
    angle(Z,gravityMean)
were not consider (by me) to fullfill the selection criteria. Actually that were not a measurement mean.  
The rest of the variables with "mean()" or "std()" in their names were included in the new data file.  
Activity and Subject variables were also included in the new data file.  
Activity names were used instead of 1:6 values.  
The data set was relabeled with descriptive variable names following the tidy data set rules, getting rid off 
from string-characters like "-()," and using full names instead of acronyms.  
Finally a new data set with the average of each variable for each activity and subject was created.
