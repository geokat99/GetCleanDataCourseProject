THIS IN NOT the actual .md file. Just checking on how to update the remote repository

Elin is correct the readme describes things like

    listing all the related files, 
    instructions on how to use the script, 
    a general description of the raw data and it's source, 
    a description of what the script will do
---------------
The CodeBook explains what the data set has: names of variables, 
a quick explanation of what they are, type of the variable (char, integer, etc.).

The Readme explains where the data comes from, how the data has been manipulated, 
what are the outputs of the process.

Some people have lost marks in previous courses for not making it easy for their reviewers 
to give them marks. Don't just make a tidy data set, make it clear to people reviewing it 
why it is tidy. When you given the variables descriptive names, 
explain why the names are descriptive. Don't give your reviewers the opportunity 
to be confused about your work, spell it out to them.
------------------------
You will be required to submit: 
1) a tidy data set as described below, 
2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 
3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations 
or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. 
You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. 
This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected
